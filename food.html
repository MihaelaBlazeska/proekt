                    This dessert actually hails from Central Asia and spread from there throughout the Ottoman world. 
                    It eventually made its way to Europe, where the Viennese modified it as strudel. Today, the indisputab

                    First appearing in the imperial capital of Istanbul in the 16th century,
                     coffee has been part of the fabric of life here ever since,
                      lending its name to breakfast (kahvaltı, or “before coffee”) and even the color brown (kahverengi).
